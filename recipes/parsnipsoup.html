  <h3>A hearty winter soup with a curry twist</h3>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 parsnips</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>2 tsp curry powder (medium or mild)</li>
    <li>750 ml vegetable stock</li>
    <li>50 ml dairy-free cream</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.</li>
    <li>
      Peel the parsnips and cut into wedges, and place in a roasting tin or baking tray. 
      Peel the onion and slice thickly and add to the tray, then add the garlic cloves - whole and unpeeled. 
      Drizzle over the oil, add the curry powder and season with salt and black pepper, 
      then toss everything together until the vegetables are fully coated with oil.
    </li>
    <li>Roast for 30 minutes until the parsnips are golden brown and soft. Remove the garlic cloves (keep them for later), 
      and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Bring the vegetable stock to the boil in a large saucepan. Tip in the roasted parsnips and onion, then squeeze the 
      soft flesh out of the roasted garlic cloves, add to the pan and discard the skin. Boil for 4-5 minutes, then remove 
      from the heat, stir through the cream then blitz to a very smooth purée with a hand blender or in a blender / food 
      processor. Taste and adjust seasoning as required.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you wish to make parsnip crisps for a garnish, simply peel strips off a parsnip with a potato peeler. Heat a little 
      oil in a frying pan and fry the strips gently until they are just turning golden brown. Watch carefully - they can burn 
      in seconds! Sprinkle with salt then remove from the pan and keep on kitchen paper until just before serving so they stay crisp.
    </li>
    <li>Serve the soup with a drizzle of cream and your parsnip crisps.</li>
  </ol>
