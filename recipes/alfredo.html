  <h3>
    Classic Alfredo Sauce is a simple but elegant creamy, white sauce that is commonly known to lay over pasta noodles.
  </h3>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons vegan butter or olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 red onion chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup of cashews soaked overnight, or in hot water for one hour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of pasta water</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, or any vegan milk</li>
    <li>4 cloves roasted garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegan parmesan cheese + extra for topping</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook pasta according to package directions in a well salted pot of water. Reserve Â¼ cup of the pasta water.</li>
    <li>
      While the pasta is boiling/you're waiting for the water to boil, in a pan over medium high heat, 
      heat the vegan butter or olive oil. Add the onion, stir and let cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>
      Remove the onions from the pan and add it to a blender. Add the rinsed off soaked cashews (without the water), 
      the pasta water, the almond milk, the roasted garlic, the nutritional yeast, the sea salt the vegan parmesan cheese 
      and the lime juice. Blend it all together until completely creamy. If you have a high powered blender this will happen 
      quickly, about 1 minute, if not, just keep blending until completely smooth and creamy. 
    </li>    
    <li>
      Taste and add more salt or vegan parmesan cheese if necessary.
    </li>
    <li> 
      When the pasta is finished boiling, drain and pour back into the pan you had used earlier or even into a 
      Tupperware container if you want. Pour the Alfredo sauce over and stir to combine completely.
    </li>
  </ol>
